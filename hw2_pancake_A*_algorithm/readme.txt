1. user input - the user should use the search function to initiate a pancake search. The search function takes in two arguments - a list of pancakes (numbers 1 - 10 in any order) and a string that tells the function what type of search the user wants - A star or UCS. The string should only be either "a*" or "ucs".
2. how to interpret the output - the search function prints out the number of steps needed to reach the goal and output the specific steps needed to be taken. Each step is formatted as a action and present state tuple. Performing an action on the present state will result in a new state.
3. the ucs algorithm may take very long time to search through pancake stacks.
